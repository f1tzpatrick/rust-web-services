# rust-web-services

This project implements the same API surface which was implemented in the Pluralsight course "Creating Web Services with Go" by Alex Schultz, with Rust using the Rocket web framework.

## The plan

- Cosmos DB
- CRUD API with Azure Functions
- API Management
- Frontend hosted... somehow
